CHOICE OF LANGUAGE : VERILOG 

REASON 
    verilog seems to be user friendly to beginners than vhdl 
    and also nowadays system verilog is in trend to learn that verilog is a prerequiste 
    
INFERENCE


     after creating the project we should code the verilog script which describes the circuit we will be working on 
     for now as we have the verilog file(adder.v) we can just upload it as a existing file .
     
     on view of elaborated design we can see the circuit which we describe through code .
     after that to verify working of the circuit we are adding the testbench which has the input parameters to test, outputs ,and specific time intervals to simulate      and adding it on simulation sources.
     
     after that on run simulation we can see the required output .
